🔹 Lesson 3: Control Flow in Java (If Statements & Loops) 🚀
Now that you understand variables & data types, let’s move to Control Flow—how Java makes decisions and repeats tasks.

📌 By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:
✅ Use if-else statements for decision-making
✅ Use loops (for, while) to repeat actions
✅ Understand how conditions work in Java

✅ 1️⃣ If-Else Statements (Decision-Making)
✔ An if statement runs code only if the condition is true.
✔ An else statement runs when the condition is false.

🔹 Example: Check if Someone Can Vote
java
Copy
Edit
public class Voting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 17;

        if (age >= 18) {  // Condition
            System.out.println("You can vote!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You cannot vote yet.");
        }
    }
}
✔ Expected Output:

nginx
Copy
Edit
You cannot vote yet.
✅ 2️⃣ If-Else If-Else (Multiple Conditions)
✔ Use else if to check multiple conditions.

🔹 Example: Grading System
java
Copy
Edit
public class Grades {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int score = 85;

        if (score >= 90) {
            System.out.println("Grade: A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
            System.out.println("Grade: B");
        } else if (score >= 70) {
            System.out.println("Grade: C");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Grade: F");
        }
    }
}
✔ Expected Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Grade: B
✅ 3️⃣ Loops in Java (Repeating Code)
✔ Loops allow Java to repeat a task multiple times.

🔹 for Loop (Fixed Repetitions)
A for loop runs a specific number of times.

java
Copy
Edit
public class LoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {  // Loops from 1 to 5
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }
    }
}
✔ Expected Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
🔹 while Loop (Runs Until a Condition is False)
A while loop keeps running as long as the condition is true.

java
Copy
Edit
public class WhileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 1;

        while (count <= 3) {  // Runs while count is 3 or less
            System.out.println("Count: " + count);
            count++;  // Increases count
        }
    }
}
✔ Expected Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
🔹 do-while Loop (Runs At Least Once)
A do-while loop always runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

java
Copy
Edit
public class DoWhileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;

        do {
            System.out.println("Number is: " + number);
            number++;
        } while (number < 3);  // ❌ This condition is already false
    }
}
✔ Expected Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Number is: 5
🔹 Why? The loop runs once before checking the condition.
